     <h1>What is Automated Cross Linux From Scratch?</h1>
     <p>Automated Cross Linux From Scratch (aCLFS) is a project that creates the
	generic framework for automated testing of xLFS books. note: It is not an official project of either LFS or CLFS. The link to CLFS is for user convenience.
     </p>

     <h2>Why would I want to use aCLFS?</h2>
     <p>aCLFS was created to support automated testing for xLFS. An ongoing concern is development resources and a set of automated test cases would leverage development resources.</p>

     <h2>What can I do with aCLFS?</h2>

     <p>The goal of aCLFS is to <em>automate</em> the process of creating an xLFS system.
	It seeks to make the process of building xLFS easier and more efficient.
	
     </p>

     <h2>Why create another LFS automation?</h2>

     <p>It appears the xLFS projects with the best level of automation are the furthest along. 
     </p>


     <h2>How is aCLFS implemented?</h2>
     <p>Unlike other implementations for automating this process, the rendered book is used. Currently the appropriate git repository is cloned/updated. At a minimum a local copy of the book containing a file that specified page order, user, directroy to execute in and location of package. If the local BOOK contains a modified copy of the page it will be given preference. The aCLFS script downloads the specified package and copies it to $CLFS}, pulls the commands from the specified page of the BOOK, executes as the user from the specified directory.</p>
