aCLFS  (Automated Cross Linux from Scratch)

This is an alternate to JHALFS for automation of the CLFS books. Currently JHALFS offers limited support 
outside of the main LFS book. 

This is the structure for aCLFS

INSTALLDIR\ 
	aCLFS			# This is the main script
	aclfs.config	# this is a link to a configuration		
	build.config	# this is a link to a configuration
	localBOOK/
			aBOOK/
				OOM
				final-preps/ 
				...
				index	# would like to create an index based on modded book as part of doPrep
				#could add a test page to the local book - rather than have it part of aCLFS
	configs/
			aCLFS/
			build/
			kernel/	#helps support automated testing
	gitBOOK/	
			clfs-embedded/	#where user can clone a repository


	Special Files:

	aCLFS.config	# specify the following variables. 
		SRC_ARCHIVE=/usr/src
		gitRepository
		BOOK #This is where git will be cloned
		localBook

	build.Config	#Required variables depend on architecture 
		${CLFS}
		${CLFS_ARCH}
		...	
	OOM	

	Consists of line entries of the form:
		pageUrl#user#base#pkgUrl


What aCLFS does:

	It preps by cloning/ updating a repository to a local directory

	(WIP) It createx index.html based on the git repository and local Book

	(WIP) It creates an OOM file when doing BLFS.

	It reads the OOM file from the local copy of the book.

	for each line in the OOM file:

		download the required source package

		copy to the ${CLFS}/sources directory
	
		change owner

		make script based on web page

		execute script as ${user}

		remove source from ${CLFS}/sources

		
	
To run:

Set up aclfs.config and build.config to meet your needs.

sudo ./aCLFS
